# Open2Test_Selenium
Open2Test_Selenium is Keyword driven Framework - supporting Continuous Integration using Gradle and Jenkins

### Synopsis: 

Open2Test framework is open source framework developed by Open source team of NTTDATA INC.
  This is framework developed for automation testing using Selenium. Aim of Open2Test framework is to provide easy way to approach automation testing. Keyword based solution formed on the premise that makes any application to be described using short text description or keywords.
  
 ### Salient Feature of Keyword Driven Testing

#### Natural language: - 
                          Keywords can be defined in natural language meaning that, test cases can be written with 
                          more or less detail, depending on the project's needs.

#### Not require technical understanding:-
                         Testers working at the business level do not require technical understanding of the test 
                         automation framework to be able to create and edit test cases

#### Maintenance:-
                         Sensitivity to changes (which can create the need for maintenance effort) is reduced.
                        Maintenance of test cases for business reasons will not affect the implementation of the 
                        keyword scripts, as long as the set of keywords and the semantics of the keywords 
                        are not changed.

#### Portability:-
                       Portability of test suites is easier to achieve, (e.g. if a similar system with almost
                       the same business cases has to be tested then many of the keywords can be reused).

#### Early Start:-
                    Automated functional tests can be implemented before the test item actually exists,either by  
                     using existing keyword libraries with their corresponding automation scripts, or by defining 
                    new keywords and adding the automation scripts later as the test interface is defined.

#### Efforts:- 
                     A limited set of keywords implies a limited effort for implementing test automation, 
                     (e.g. usually, one automated keyword script for each keyword will be sufficient).
