Open2Test_Selenium is Keyword driven Framework - supporting Continuous Integration using Gradle and Jenkins

### Synopsis: 

Open2Test framework is open source framework developed by Open source team of NTTDATA INC.
  This is framework developed for automation testing using Selenium. Aim of Open2Test framework is to provide easy way to approach automation testing. Keyword based solution formed on the premise that makes any application to be described using short text description or keywords.

## Salient Features of Keyword Driven Testing
 
#### Natural language: - 
Keywords can be defined in natural language meaning that, test cases can be written with more or less detail, 
depending on the project's needs.

#### Not require technical understanding:-
Testers working at the business level do not require technical understanding of the test automation framework to 
be able to create and edit test cases

#### Maintenance:-
Sensitivity to changes (which can create the need for maintenance effort) is reduced. Maintenance of test cases for
business reasons will not affect the implementation of the Keyword scripts, as long as the set of keywords and the 
semantics of the keywords are not changed.

#### Portability:-
  Portability of test suites is easier to achieve, (e.g. if a similar system with almost the same 
  business cases has to be tested then many of the keywords can be reused).

#### Early Start:-
  Automated functional tests can be implemented before the test item actually exists, either by sing existing
  keyword libraries with their corresponding automation scripts, or by defining new keywords and adding the 
  automation scripts later as the test interface is defined.

#### Efforts:- 
  A limited set of keywords implies a limited effort for implementing test automation, (e.g. usually, one 
  automated keyword script for each keyword will be sufficient).

![folder_structure](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25658523/24182616/07bac4e8-0ee9-11e7-8f67-a71db53c7983.png)


## Sample Scripting

Please refer sample scripting from downloaded zip. 
1.	Change the path of variable utilityFilePath from setting.java file to SeleniumUtility file of downloaded /cloned folder. 
    E.g.  
Public String utilityFilePath=
              *"D:\downloaded_project\open2Test\o2t\\Sample script\\SeleniumUtility.xlsx";*
              
2.	Change the path of Test Suite, Object repository and other variables from utility file as per 
                             local downloaded folder structure.

3.	Select the appropriate browser. And make sure the browser driver is matching /compatible with selected browser. 
         Browser driver exe given here is for Windows 32 bit. Download 64 bit from - *http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/*

#### Executing Gradle Project on Local Machine: 
 Traverse to Root folder of the project on Command prompt.
1. Use the command “gradle build” on Command prompt for executng the build . . . 	[Gradle Executin]

## Appendix A

#### Layers in Keyword-Driven Testing:
Keyword-Driven Testing can be organized by using one or more layers. Typical layers are

 #### End user domain layer 
 #### Test interface layer.

While many implementations of Keyword-Driven Testing will comprise two or three abstraction layers, 
in some cases it may be necessary to structure keywords in more layers.

#### Abstract layer:
The topmost layer is the most abstract layer which is generally aligned with the wording of the application's users. 
In practice, the topmost layer is usually the domain layer. 
However, in some situations the domain layer may not be required, and another, more abstract layer is used 
(e.g. if the test cases are supposed to span several different end user domains, a Meta domain layer can be introduced).

#### Detailed layer:
The lowest layer is the most detailed layer. It is commonly aligned with the names of test interface elements   
in practice, this layer is usually, but not always, the test interface layer (e.g. asSometimes a test interface layer 
is not required, or for specific reasons, even more detailed layers may be used).  
    Most Keyword-Driven Test systems will have more than one layer due to factors such as having understandable
    keyword test cases, maintainability and division of work relying on a multi-layer structure. If only one layer 
    is implemented, it will commonly be either at a low level, which affects the readability of the keyword test cases,
    or at a high level, which can result in more keyword execution code.
    
 ### Types of keywords
 
#### Simple keywords
       
Simple keywords, which are often used at the test interface layer (e.g. "MenuSelect" or "PressButton"), can be the
connection between the test execution tool and higher level keywords at an intermediate layer or domain layer.
    Using only keywords at the test interface layer can be sufficient for the definition of test cases and their execution. 
    Exclusive use of simple keywords will lead to test cases with many actions. Depending on the test item, keywords at the test
    interface layer could need to interact with different systems such as databases, the system registry or SOA-Messages.
           In a similar way, the automation framework will support access to the test interface or other interfaces on
           which the keyword operates (e.g. mouse, keyboard, and touch screen).
           
                 
#### Composite keywords
        
Simple keywords are sufficient to compose and execute test cases but are often insufficient to reflect 
functional features. Composite keywords are keywords composed from other keywords. This means that keywords 
can be organized in different layers (see 5.2). For composite keywords, composite parameters (e.g. a data structure) 
can be required. It is often useful to use business-level keywords, such as “login user“. This keyword may be composed
of a sequence of lower level keywords, such as “enter username“, “enter password“ and "push login-button“. 
For more complex business objects, such as large forms for the preparation of contracts, a keyword like 
“filloutContractformPage1” can be valuable.
   A composite keyword is a ‘package’ containing a sequence of other keywords. The set of parameters for a 
composite keyword can be the union of the set of parameters of the keywords that comprise the composite keyword;
sometimes however, the implementer of a composite keyword may choose to ‘hide’ one or more parameters by 
assigning it a literal value within the composite.
       
 #### Navigation/interaction (input) and verification (output)

 *Keywords may be classified into at least two categories:*
 
#### Navigation steps (i.e. input to the test item) and
#### Verification steps (i.e. output from test item).

Most keywords belong to the first category, (i.e. the navigation steps) because most actions are needed to prepare
the test item or perform certain actions on it which will lead to a result. Navigation steps usually are steps 
that do not verify and log the test result.


The result is then checked by one or more other actions i.e. the verification steps.

The verification steps are related to the result of the test case. For example, if the condition of a verification
step is not met, then the test result will be set to "failed".

It may be useful to allow navigation steps to be used for verification.

 #### Keyword Driven Framework
   
  ![keyword_driven](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25658523/24182623/11bde722-0ee9-11e7-81cb-d05f58cfa516.png)


#### Keywords and Data
Keyword-Driven Testing can be enhanced if keywords are associated with data. To allow an association with data,
in many cases keywords will need to have parameters which may be fixed, or list driven.
       Most keywords will need to have at least one parameter to specify the object they apply to. 
       Some will need another parameter to specify input, (e.g., true/false, a string to type, an 
       option to select in a combo box). This input will generally depend on the type of control and the type of action.
